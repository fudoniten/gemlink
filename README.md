# Gemini Server

This project is a simple server for the Gemini protocol, written in Clojure. The Gemini protocol is a lightweight, text-based protocol designed for serving content over the internet, similar to HTTP but much simpler and more privacy-focused.

## Inspiration

This project was largely inspired by Ring's simplicity and middleware-based architecture. The simple Gemtext DSL was inspired by Hiccup.

## Features

- **Gemtext Support**: The server uses a Hiccup-like language called Gemtext for generating Gemini-formatted text files. This allows for easy and expressive creation of content that can be served over the Gemini protocol.

- **Clojure-based**: Built entirely in Clojure, leveraging its functional programming capabilities and rich ecosystem.
